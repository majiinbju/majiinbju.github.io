    "description": "This was an exciting and challenging shoot because it was a prank and it required me to work in stealth. Without the crew of Lionsgate knowing, we managed to prank all the people in the set. I used go-pros like a ninja, hidden cameras on tripods and worked on sound recording all in the span of 20 mins.",
