    "description": "This project was a 5 day shoot. An exciting project that was held for the class of content creators held by YouTube. They gave sets, camera equipment, lectures and in the end a small competition with a big reward. I met Raja Kumari, Nikhil Mumbiker and other celebrities on this project. I was the second cameraman, operated on go-pros and a gimbal running from one set to another and then to the next.",
