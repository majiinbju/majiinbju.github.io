    "description": "We flew to Chennai to the Madras Race Club for this amazing project. Not only did I get to witness those beasts in action but I also had the opportunity to sit in a Huracan. I was the second cameraman recording interviews and the sound. I was also the go-pro operator aiming to capture reactions and facial expressions of the lucky drivers.",
