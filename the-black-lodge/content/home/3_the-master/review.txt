Title: The Master

Synopsis: Best movie of all time.

Analysis:

Freddie represents the ape/animal side of humans seeking immediate gratification of one's desires. It is symbolic that his posture resembles to that of an ape. It is also shown in the opening scenes that he's climbing trees, wanking in the ocean, shagging a woman made out of sand, farting and PSH in return calling him a "Dirty animal", substance abuse and acting out aggressively in social spaces etc. There could be a reading from the vantage point of army's deleterious effects on a man. But I propose the opposite. I think Freddie for several reasons has certain issues and the army made Freddie feel at home. It gave him a pathway to behave in ways what would be considered deviating highly from social norms (starting from channeling his aggression to killing people). It is reiterated every time he has to socialize, he inevitably gets into trouble and has to leave. The fact he feels comfortable around oceans/boats is also symbolic that he prefers a life similar to what was in the navy -> the vastness of the ocean representing a constraint-less environment without the forces of civilization shackling him


Lancaster meanwhile represents the civilized & moral man. He is also a charlatan/leader of cult that practices techniques which supposedly can "Correct us to the inherent state of perfect". His image is the big patriarchal figure that has absolute control over life and thus understandably has lot of people particularly woman attracted to him. Freddie here fits into Lancaster's world as a show dog that will cement the credibility of Lancaster's cult long term, if "The Cause" is able to successfully convert Freddie into a civilized man. For Freddie's this is potential opportunity for him to find a way out of his misery. Peggy meanwhile fits in to picture as a intermediary who understands the instinctual nature of humans and also the civilizational needs and thus leveraging power in social spaces via Lancaster AKA the mediating ego. I think it was made clear when she gives him a handjob in the bathroom despite what Lancaster's "The Cause" preaches others -> to absolutely suppress one's sexual instincts. And Lancaster saying to Freddie in the climax " For if you figure a way to live without serving a master...any master...then let the rest us know, will you? For you'd be the first person in the history of the world." which at a first reading implies Freddie the animal will need a master to live his life but also implying even Lancaster himself needs a master in Peggy to help him live a balanced life.

The rest of the movie in a nutshell explores these characters but under a plot narrative whether Lancaster's ambitions (one could even argue that is a 2000 year old philosophical question) are actually possible or a load of horseshit. And it is revealed that it is full of shit. Lancaster is incredibly insecure when faced with criticism and resorts to yelling at people (House party scene and Laura Dern questioning inconsistencies in his book). His son telling Freddie that he's making it up as he goes along. When Freddie refuses to stay, he promises Freddie that he will be his sworn enemy in next life. He then starts singing the song that Freddie has closest to his heart in a cynical way with the intention to exploit his situation of vulnerability. It also explains why Lancaster records private information of his patient's on a tape to engage in this sort of blackmailing thus making it difficult for people to leave the cult. The handjob scene also undermines and unfeasibility of his ideas.

Overall, I think is very telling that people especially cult leaders who promise this ideal world that is free of misery are just inevitably exposed as a bunch of charlatans. It appears I also explained the plot narrative of Clockwork Orange too as I'm typing this. Very similar.
